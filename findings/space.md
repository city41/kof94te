## P ROM

There is about 160kb from 969c8 to c0001. I've used clobberZeroSpan.ts and the game works just fine. That should be plenty of room.

## C ROM

The character select screen will need about 100 tiles. 4 tiles per character portrait, and there are 26 characters (24 regular plus the 2 bosses). At the end of C7/C8 there is over 200 blank tiles. That should be plenty. If not, the beginning of C1/C2 has about 500 kanji tiles that are almost certainly not used in the game.

## S ROM

The S ROM is pretty much completely full. But I doubt we'll need anything added to it. Should be ok.

## V ROM

I doubt we will need any additional sound effects/music. Can just use the existing ones from the existing char select screen.
