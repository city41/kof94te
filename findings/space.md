# Space

## P ROM

There is about 160kb from 969c8 to c0001. I've used clobberZeroSpan.ts and the game works just fine. That should be plenty of room.

## C ROM

bg_oceans: 18x14 = 252
logo_countries: 15x10 = 150
character_grid: 18x6 = 108
total: 538

Actually the total is 411 as there are a lot of duplicate tiles.

## S ROM

The S ROM is pretty much completely full. But I doubt we'll need anything added to it. Should be ok.

## V ROM

I doubt we will need any additional sound effects/music. Can just use the existing ones from the existing char select screen.

# Available Sprites

The game has taken control of most of the sprites. If going forward with the hack method, about 57 sprites would need to be available.

320 seems to be the upper sprite the game controls, leaving 321-380, 60 sprites
