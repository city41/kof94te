# Same team bug

Sometimes with cpu custom teams, the game won't pick a new team for the next round, just stick with the previous team.

## Clues

- It might require human random select
- It might require AES mode

- It can happen in team or single play
- When this happens, there is no cpu cursor shown

- seems to happen more often on main (1.2.2) than the trap branch

- I _think_ it did happen once on the trap branch
