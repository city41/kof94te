# King of Fighters 94: Team Edit Edition

Discord: https://discord.gg/Uuaka5mq

A ROM hack for KOF94 that adds team edit.

King of Fighters is a fighting game franchise where teams of three fight each other. The first entry, King of Fighters '94, does not allow you to pick your own team

Instead you must choose from pre-formed teams. From King of Fighters '95 on, you could create your own team. Here is KOF95's character select screen

This hack brings custom teams to KOF94:

- A full character select screen similar to KOF95's
- Random character and random team select options
- Custom teams properly shown in win screens
- Win quotes properly adjusted to custom teams
- Custom teams properly shown in the continue screen
- Custom teams properly shown in cutscenes and endings
- Some minor versus mode quality of life improvements
  - Randomly chooses a background to fight on
  - Each player can choose a new team before each match
- The CPU can choose custom teams too. More info here: https://neorh.mattgreer.dev/#cpu-custom-teams

Since doing a new ending wasn't really feasible, the hack contains four reworked endings if you win the game with a custom team.

If you play through the single player mode with one of the original 8 teams, you will get that team's original cutscenes and ending.

## Status

The hack is complete.
