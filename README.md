# King of Fighters 94: Team Edit Edition

A ROM hack for KOF94 that adds team edit. Essentially it ports the character select screen from kof95 over.

King of Fighters is a fighting game franchise where teams of three fight each other. The first entry, King of Fighters '94 (which is also my favorite), does not allow you to pick your own team

Instead you must choose from pre-formed teams. From King of Fighters '95 on, you could create your own team. Here is KOF95's character select screen

This hack is bringing this character select screen into KOF94. It will look very much like KOF95's, but using KOF94 theming. Then you can create whatever team you want in KOF94.

## Status

Just started working on this. I've made a ton of progress and learned a lot about how the game works. I am pretty sure I can pull this off. But it will still be a while...
